# UFOs
## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build an interactive webpage for end users to get more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, youâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
## Resources
- Data Source: UFO data
- Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, BootStrap.

## Summary
- One of the constraints of this design is that the filteration process is not flexible to the user.
- A way to address this would be to present drop-down lists including all filter values in place of the input fields.
Each list would need to update after a parameter is selected in any filter.
- Also, a filter clearing button can be added to clear the filter.
